Property Test: Storage Despite Notification Failure

Property 28: For any incident where the notification service fails, the incident
store must still persist the complete incident record.

Validates: Requirements 12.5

Note: This property tests the Step Functions orchestration logic, not individual
Lambda functions. In the actual workflow, notification and storage happen in
parallel branches, so notification failure doesn't block storage.

This test validates the design principle that storage is independent of notification.
